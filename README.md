# Application name
*BOOK REVIEW*
# Description
Book Review App is an application that allows users to add reviews for their favorite books and rate them. Users can submit reviews with the title, author, rating, and review text. The app also enables users to edit or delete their own reviews.

I chose this project because it allows users to share their book experiences with others, creating a community of people who care about reading and reviewing books.


# Instructions
1. To get started: Sign up through the main page.
2. Add a review: Once signed in, you can add a review for your favorite book.
3. Edit/Delete Reviews: You can edit or delete your reviews anytime.
4. View All Reviews: You can visit the "All Reviews" page to see all the reviews.
